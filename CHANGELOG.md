# Changelog

**Why this looks different:** the project was renamed from **Clawdis → Clawdbot**. To make the transition clear, releases now use **date-based versions** (`YYYY.M.D`) and the changelog is **compressed** into milestone summaries. Full detail still lives in git history and the docs.

## Unreleased

### Breaking
- **SECURITY (update ASAP):** inbound DMs are now **locked down by default** on Telegram/WhatsApp/Signal/iMessage/Discord/Slack.
  - Previously, if you didn’t configure an allowlist, your bot could be **open to anyone** (especially discoverable Telegram bots).
  - New default: DM pairing (`dmPolicy="pairing"` / `discord.dm.policy="pairing"` / `slack.dm.policy="pairing"`).
  - To keep old “open to everyone” behavior: set `dmPolicy="open"` and include `"*"` in the relevant `allowFrom` (Discord/Slack: `discord.dm.allowFrom` / `slack.dm.allowFrom`).
  - Approve requests via `clawdbot pairing list --provider <provider>` + `clawdbot pairing approve --provider <provider> <code>` (Telegram also supports `clawdbot telegram pairing ...`).
- Sandbox: default `agent.sandbox.scope` to `"agent"` (one container/workspace per agent). Use `"session"` for per-session isolation; `"shared"` disables cross-session isolation.
- Timestamps in agent envelopes are now UTC (compact `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mmZ`); removed `messages.timestampPrefix`. Add `agent.userTimezone` to tell the model the user’s local time (system prompt only).
- Model config schema changes (auth profiles + model lists); doctor auto-migrates and the gateway rewrites legacy configs on startup.
- Commands: gate all slash commands to authorized senders; add `/compact` to manually compact session context.
- Groups: `whatsapp.groups`, `telegram.groups`, and `imessage.groups` now act as allowlists when set. Add `"*"` to keep allow-all behavior.
- Auto-reply: removed `autoReply` from Discord/Slack/Telegram channel configs; use `requireMention` instead (Telegram topics now support `requireMention` overrides).
- CLI: remove `update`, `gateway-daemon`, `gateway {install|uninstall|start|stop|restart|daemon status|wake|send|agent}`, and `telegram` commands; move `login/logout` to `providers login/logout` (top-level aliases hidden); use `daemon` for service control, `send`/`agent`/`wake` for RPC, and `nodes canvas` for canvas ops.

### Fixes
- CLI/Daemon: add `clawdbot logs` tailing and improve restart/service hints across platforms.
- Auto-reply: keep typing indicators alive during tool execution without changing typing-mode semantics. Thanks @thesash for PR #452.
- macOS: harden Voice Wake tester/runtime (pause trigger, mic persistence, local-only tester) and keep transcript logs private. Thanks @xadenryan for PR #438.
- macOS: preserve node bridge tunnel port override so remote nodes connect on the bridge port. Thanks @sircrumpet for PR #364.
- Doctor/Daemon: surface gateway runtime state + port collision diagnostics; warn on legacy workspace dirs.
- Gateway/CLI: include gateway target/source details in close/timeout errors and verbose health/status output.

- macOS: ignore ciao announcement cancellation rejections during Bonjour shutdown to avoid unhandled exits. Thanks @emanuelst for PR #419.
- Pairing: generate DM pairing codes with CSPRNG, expire pending codes after 1 hour, and avoid re-sending codes for already pending requests.
- Pairing: lock + atomically write pairing stores with 0600 perms and stop logging pairing codes in provider logs.
- WhatsApp: add self-phone mode (no pairing replies for outbound DMs) and onboarding prompt for personal vs separate numbers (auto allowlist + response prefix for personal).
- Discord: include all inbound attachments in `MediaPaths`/`MediaUrls` (back-compat `MediaPath`/`MediaUrl` still first).
- Sandbox: add `agent.sandbox.workspaceAccess` (`none`/`ro`/`rw`) to control agent workspace visibility inside the container; `ro` hard-disables `write`/`edit`.

## 2026.1.5-2

### Fixes
- NPM package: include `dist/sessions` so `clawdbot agent` resolves session helpers in npx installs.

## 2026.1.5-1

### Fixes
- NPM package: include `dist/sessions` so `clawdbot agent` resolves session helpers in npx installs.
- Node 25: avoid unsupported directory import by targeting `qrcode-terminal/vendor/QRCode/index.js`.

## 2026.1.5

### Highlights
- Models: add image-specific model config (`agent.imageModel` + fallbacks) and scan support.
- Agent tools: new `image` tool routed to the image model (when configured).
- Config: default model shorthands (`opus`, `sonnet`, `gpt`, `gpt-mini`, `gemini`, `gemini-flash`).
- Docs: document built-in model shorthands + precedence (user config wins).
- Bun: optional local install/build workflow without maintaining a Bun lockfile (see `docs/bun.md`).

### Fixes
- Control UI: render Markdown in tool result cards.
- Control UI: prevent overlapping action buttons in Discord guild rules on narrow layouts.
- Android: tapping the foreground service notification brings the app to the front. (#179) — thanks @Syhids
- Cron tool uses `id` for update/remove/run/runs (aligns with gateway params). (#180) — thanks @adamgall
- Control UI: chat view uses page scroll with sticky header/sidebar and fixed composer (no inner scroll frame).
- macOS: treat location permission as always-only to avoid iOS-only enums. (#165) — thanks @Nachx639
- macOS: make generated gateway protocol models `Sendable` for Swift 6 strict concurrency. (#195) — thanks @andranik-sahakyan
- macOS: bundle QR code renderer modules so DMG gateway boot doesn't crash on missing qrcode-terminal vendor files.
- macOS: parse JSON5 config safely to avoid wiping user settings when comments are present.
- WhatsApp: suppress typing indicator during heartbeat background tasks. (#190) — thanks @mcinteerj
- WhatsApp: mark offline history sync messages as read without auto-reply. (#193) — thanks @mcinteerj
- Discord: avoid duplicate replies when a provider emits late streaming `text_end` events (OpenAI/GPT).
- CLI: use tailnet IP for local gateway calls when bind is tailnet/auto (fixes #176).
- Env: load global `$CLAWDBOT_STATE_DIR/.env` (`~/.clawdbot/.env`) as a fallback after CWD `.env`.
- Env: optional login-shell env fallback (opt-in; imports expected keys without overriding existing env).
- Agent tools: OpenAI-compatible tool JSON Schemas (fix `browser`, normalize union schemas).
- Onboarding: when running from source, auto-build missing Control UI assets (`bun run ui:build`).
- Discord/Slack: route reaction + system notifications to the correct session (no main-session bleed).
- Agent tools: honor `agent.tools` allow/deny policy even when sandbox is off.

## 2026.1.5

### Fixes
- Control UI: render Markdown in chat messages (sanitized).


## 2026.1.4

### Highlights
- Rename completion: all CLIs, paths, bundle IDs, env vars, and docs standardized on **Clawdbot**.
- Agent-to-agent relay: `sessions_send` ping‑pong with `REPLY_SKIP` plus announce step with `ANNOUNCE_SKIP`.
- Gateway quality-of-life: config hot reload, port config support, and Control UI base paths.
- Sandbox additions: per-session Docker sandbox with hardened limits + optional sandboxed Chromium.
- New node capability: `location.get` across macOS/iOS/Android (CLI + tools).
- Models CLI: scan OpenRouter free models (tools/images), manage aliases/fallbacks, and show last-used model in status.

### Breaking
- Tool names drop the `clawdbot_` prefix (`browser`, `canvas`, `nodes`, `cron`, `gateway`).
- Bash tool removes node-pty `stdinMode: "pty"` support (use tmux for real TTYs).
- Primary session key is fixed to `main` (or `global` for global scope).

### Fixes
- Doctor migrates legacy Clawdis config/service installs and normalizes sandbox Docker names.
